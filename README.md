#Facememe v0.1.0

Facememe is a prototypal, mobile/desktop based facial recognition web application.

Using your device and it's webcam you can choose to either take a live picture of yourself, or upload an existing portrait to the application, and compare your face against others to see just how similar you look (protip - the current "database" contains pictures of supermodels).

Webcam support currently only works on both desktop and mobile versions of Chrome, but standard uploads should work on all the latest browsers.##
